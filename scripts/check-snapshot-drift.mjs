/**
 * Do `schema.ts`, the newest drizzle snapshot and the catalogue the migrations actually build all
 * describe the same indexes?
 *
 * There are three artefacts and `pnpm db:generate` only ever compares two of them: it diffs
 * `schema.ts` against the newest snapshot. `0000_init.sql` in this folder is the generator's output
 * with `IF NOT EXISTS` added to every statement by hand, and every migration after it will be
 * hand-written or hand-guarded in the same way — so the third artefact, the database, has never been
 * compared to either of the other two by anything. An index that goes into a `.sql` file and into
 * neither of the others leaves that pair agreeing with each other, and generate stays silent.
 *
 * The consequence is not cosmetic. The day somebody adds that index to `schema.ts`, generate emits
 * `CREATE INDEX` with no `IF NOT EXISTS`, and every instance that already ran the hand-written
 * migration takes a 42P07 that aborts the whole upgrade transaction — which for a module's
 * migrations is a host service that never binds its port. The mirror image is worse: delete a
 * `uniqueIndex` from `schema.ts` and generate proposes `DROP INDEX`, quietly handing back an
 * invariant the database was enforcing. Three of the indexes here *are* the module's invariants —
 * one live meeting per room, one live huddle per object, one live participant per person — so that
 * is not an abstract risk.
 *
 * The suite cannot catch either even in principle. Every integration run builds a fresh scratch
 * database and applies the whole folder to it, so a duplicate `CREATE INDEX` is never attempted; the
 * collision only ever bites a database that already ran the earlier migration.
 *
 * So this closes both edges of the triangle:
 *
 *   schema.ts <-> snapshot   `drizzle-kit generate` into a throwaway copy of `migrations/`.
 *                            Anything it would write is drift, in whichever direction, and the
 *                            file it writes is the report. Needs no database.
 *
 *   snapshot <-> database    Apply every migration to a scratch database, then for each index the
 *                            snapshot declares ask Postgres to *build the index the snapshot
 *                            describes* and compare `pg_get_indexdef` of the two. Building it is
 *                            what makes the comparison exact: both strings come out of the same
 *                            deparser, so column list, expressions, sort direction, nulls
 *                            ordering, partial predicate, storage parameters, access method,
 *                            uniqueness and INCLUDE columns are all compared without this script
 *                            having to know how Postgres spells any of them.
 *
 * That second edge is the only thing that can catch a **poisoned index expression**: writing
 * `desc(t.startedAt)` instead of `t.startedAt.desc()` reaches for the *query* helper, which drizzle
 * records in the snapshot as a SQL expression Postgres will not build — while the emitted
 * `CREATE INDEX` stays valid, so the migration applies, the database is right, and `db:generate`
 * proposes the index again for ever. Nothing else in this repository looks at that.
 *
 * What the second edge does not compare, because Postgres does not record it:
 *
 *   * `concurrently`. It is how an index was built, not a property of the index; afterwards the
 *     two are indistinguishable. The first edge still compares it against `schema.ts`.
 *   * sort direction and nulls ordering under an access method that cannot order (gin, gist).
 *     There is nothing to order, so `pg_indexam_has_property(..., 'can_order')` is false and the
 *     snapshot's `asc`/`nulls` for those columns are not rendered into the probe either.
 *
 * The scope of each edge differs and it is worth being exact about which. The first compares
 * everything drizzle models — tables, columns, defaults, constraints, policies, the lot — because
 * drizzle does the comparing. The second compares indexes in `mod_meet` and nothing else: a column
 * default or an RLS policy a hand-written migration invented is not looked for here, and would go
 * unreported. Say so rather than letting the next reader assume the second edge is as wide as the
 * first. (`migrations.test.ts` is what asks the catalogue about the policies.)
 *
 * A snapshot field this script cannot reproduce fails the check by name (KNOWN_* below) instead of
 * being skipped, which is what stops this header drifting back into a claim nobody kept.
